# README

Loose Leaf is a PHP framework for people named *Zachary Danger Campbell*. If your name is not *Zachary Danger Campbell*, then I wouldn't suggest even attempting to use this framework.

That said, frameworks are boring until you build something in them. Frameworks are also often unwieldy and stupid. This framework was born out of necessity. My necessity. I needed a stripped down framework. No bells. No whistles. I needed unit testing.

Loose Leaf is a glove, custom tailored to my arthritic claw.

## Don't use me.

Seriously, right now. This framework has been cobbled together out of the several projects it was informally built as part of. If you want to use a framework, I can not recommend [Artisan System](http://artisansystem.com) because my friend, Vic, built it and he's a jerk. :]

## Dependencies

* PHP 5.3+
* PHPUnit 3.5+ (to run the test suite)
* A healthy dose of self loathing
